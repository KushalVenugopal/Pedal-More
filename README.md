# Pedal-More

Pedal More is a Full-Stack project, born from collaboration in Design Computing Studio at The University of Queensland - November 2022

The design studio focused on picking and solving a problem in Brisbane City, focusing on making life easier for the residents.
This project set out to solve common issues that bikers face in and around Brisbane City, and also to encourage people to use bikes more.
